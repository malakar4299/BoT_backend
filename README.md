## Introduction
This repository contains the backend code for an Express server, which is responsible for handling server-side operations. The server has been deployed on the Heroku platform, and a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline has been set up to automatically deploy new code whenever changes are pushed to the repository. The code follows an MVC architecture.

## File Structure
The file structure of the repository is organized as follows:

### package.json
This file contains all the necessary dependencies and scripts for the project.

### app.js
The `app.js` file is the entry point for the Express server. It contains the base code for initializing and configuring the server.

### .env
The `.env` file stores environment variables used in the project. These variables may include sensitive information such as API keys or database credentials.

### views
The `views` folder contains the templates and HTML blocks used for rendering dynamic content on the server-side. These views are usually populated with data retrieved from the server before being sent to the client.

### routes
The `routes` folder contains the implementation of specific routes or endpoints for handling HTTP requests. Each route corresponds to a specific URL path and defines the logic for processing incoming requests and returning appropriate responses.

### models
The `models` folder houses the Mongoose models used in the project. These models represent the structure and behavior of the data stored in a database and provide an abstraction layer for interacting with the data.

## Getting Started
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the Git clone command.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the `npm install` command in the project root directory.
4. Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running the `npm start` command.
5. The server should now be running, and you can access it by visiting the appropriate URL in your web browser.
